Functional Programming Notes and Exercises

Welcome to my Functional Programming course repository! This repository contains my notes and exercises from the functional programming course. The course covers various topics in functional programming, including lists, infinite lists, trees, monads, and more.
Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders and files, each focusing on different aspects of functional programming:

    alberi/: Contains notes and exercises related to trees in functional programming.
    c/: Contains notes and exercises on combinators or other specific topics starting with 'c'.
    liste infinite/: Contains notes and exercises on infinite lists.
    liste/: Contains notes and exercises on finite lists.
    monadi/: Contains notes and exercises on monads.
    funcListe.md: A markdown file with summarized notes on functional lists.
    test.hs: Haskell script file used for testing code snippets and exercises.

How to Use

    Navigate through the folders: Each folder contains specific topics covered in the functional programming course. You can browse through the folders to find the relevant notes and exercises.
    Read the Markdown files: Markdown files (.md) contain detailed explanations and notes. Start with these to understand the concepts before diving into the exercises.
    Execute the Haskell scripts: The .hs files contain Haskell code examples and exercises. You can run these files using a Haskell compiler or interpreter to see the code in action.

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/LinCanNerd/Functional-Programming.git

Navigate to the repository:

bash

    cd Functional-Programming

    Explore the content: Open the folders and files to explore the notes and exercises.

Prerequisites

To run the Haskell scripts, you need to have a Haskell compiler or interpreter installed. You can use GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) for this purpose.
